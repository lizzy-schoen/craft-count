    <h1>Craft Count - Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 19, 2026</p>

    <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>Craft Count stores the following data to provide its functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Your Alexa User ID</strong> - A unique identifier provided by Amazon to associate your data with your account. We do not have access to your name, email, or other personal information.</li>
        <li><strong>Project names</strong> - The names you give your knitting projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Row counts</strong> - Your current row number for each project.</li>
        <li><strong>Reminders</strong> - Row-specific notes you set (e.g., "decrease two stitches").</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>Your data is used solely to provide the Craft Count skill functionality - tracking your knitting row count and reminders across sessions. We do not use your data for any other purpose.</p>

    <h2>Where Data Is Stored</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored in Amazon DynamoDB, a secure cloud database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Data is encrypted at rest and in transit.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, share, or transfer your data to any third parties. Your data is only accessed by the Craft Count skill when you interact with it.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>Your data is retained as long as you use the skill. You can delete individual projects by saying "delete" followed by the project name. If you disable the Craft Count skill, your data will be retained for 30 days and then automatically deleted.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Craft Count is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue on our <a href="https://github.com/lizzy-schoen/craft-count">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
